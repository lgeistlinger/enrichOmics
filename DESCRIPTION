Title: Functional enrichment analysis of high-throughput omics data
Version: 1.0.0
Description:
    Overview of existing methods for enrichment analysis of gene expression data
    with regard to functional gene sets, pathways, and networks. Functionality 
    for differential expression analysis, set- and network-based enrichment 
    analysis, along with visualization and exploration of results. Introduction 
    to concepts for enrichment analysis of genomic regions and regulatory
    elements. Outlook on current developments to extend gene set enrichment
    analysis for data derived from multiple high-throughput omics assays.
