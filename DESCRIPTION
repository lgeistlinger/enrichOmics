Version: 1.0.0
Title: Functional enrichment analysis of high-throughput omics data
Author: Ludwig Geistlinger, Levi Waldron
Maintainer: Ludwig Geistlinger <Ludwig.Geistlinger@sph.cuny.edu>
Description: Overview of existing methods for enrichment analysis of gene
    expression data with regard to functional gene sets, pathways, and networks.
    Functionality for differential expression analysis, set- and network-based
    enrichment analysis, along with visualization and exploration of results.
    Introduction to concepts for enrichment analysis of genomic regions and
    regulatory elements. Outlook on current developments to extend gene set
    enrichment analysis for data derived from multiple high-throughput omics
    assays.
