# enrichOmics

Overview of existing methods for enrichment analysis of gene expression data with regard to functional gene sets, pathways, and networks. Functionality for differential expression analysis, set- and network-based enrichment analysis, along with visualization and exploration of results. Introduction to concepts for enrichment analysis of genomic regions and regulatory elements. Outlook on current developments to extend gene set enrichment analysis for data derived from multiple high-throughput omics assays.
